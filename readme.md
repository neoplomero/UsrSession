Introduction
------------

This is a simple but robust project which is a great and
functional "user manager" developed in laravel with the 
Repository Pattern and OOP in order to make a nice impression
and get an internship in Square1 =) (see you soon guys). For 
this I've used packages and tools like: 

*	[Laravel-4-Generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators) by Jeffrey Way.
To Generate tables, models, seeds, etc.

*	[fzaninotto/Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) by  fzaninotto.
To Generate the fake data into the tables.

*	[barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) by barryvdh.
To Monitor the different queries.

*	[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
To the CSS.


In this project you can:

*	View a list of the last registered users
*	Create Users
*	Log in
*	Modify your account
*	Delete your user
*	View the other users full info in a paginate list.
*	Log out	
*	have fun

Installation.
-------------

1.	Clone the project.
2.	Configure the app/config/database.php with your database
data, the default data is: --'database' => 'usrsession' --'username' => 'root'-- 'password' => 'root'
3.	Create the tables.
4.	Migrate.
5.	Have fun.
6.	Contact me.




Note that in the repository there is an usrsession.sql file in case
you want to add my database seeded. you will only need to configure
your username and mysql password.
